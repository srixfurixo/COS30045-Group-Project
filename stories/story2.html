      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic was a formidable test for healthcare systems worldwide, exposing vulnerabilities and gaps in preparedness. A crucial metric that emerged was healthcare expenditure, measured as a percentage of GDP, and its correlation to COVID-19 mortality rates. This analysis focuses on the relationship between healthcare spending and mortality, shedding light on how resource allocation impacted countries' abilities to respond to the crisis.</p>

      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>Analysing monthly data on COVID-19 mortality rates alongside healthcare expenditure reveals significant patterns. The graph aims to show the differences in countries that had invested large amounts of money to improve the quality of their healthcare systems and how that correlates to the total mortalities it faced. However, some countries had lower spendings therefore providing additional insight to the graph.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The analysis underscores that while higher healthcare spending correlates with a more resilient response to health crises, it alone does not guarantee low mortality rates. Factors like healthcare accessibility, government policies, and pre-existing healthcare infrastructure also play a critical role. For future preparedness, countries might consider not only increasing healthcare investment but also focusing on building efficient, adaptive healthcare systems that can better respond to sudden surges in demand, as witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
